          <h2>The Moment You Stole My Heart❤️✨</h2>

       <p> I still remember the first time I saw you I literally froze. I know it sounds super filmy, like how can someone go crazy over just one glance? It might seem fake to others, but trust me, it's the absolute truth. </p>
<p>
The moment I saw you, I knew Affan Malik if you don’t try, you'll spend your whole life regretting it. I'm genuinely obsessed with you. I love talking about your interests, your thoughts everything about you. Ever since I saw you, I can't focus on anything, can't get anything done properly. </p>

<p> Sometimes, I feel like I've turned into a total ‘nibba,’ but honestly? If it's for you, I don’t even mind it.

          <h2>More Than Just a Feeling❤️</h2>
          <p>
            I never thought I’d feel something this strong just by seeing someone. I never believed in love at first sight, but then I saw you, AZEEN, and everything changed. </p>
<p>

Maybe to you, this seems like nothing, but for me, it’s different. I’ve never been the type to get attracted so quickly, never thought about someone as a partner right away. But with you, it’s like I can’t stop thinking about you. </p>
<p>

You feel RARE and SPECIAL to me. I don’t want anything in return, I just want to do what I can for you. My pride, ego, and even self-respect don’t matter when it comes to you. </p>
<p>
Idk what this feeling is maybe love, maybe something else but whatever it is, it’s real and it’s deep. I won’t call it love at first sight, but I’ll call it something special because that’s what you are to me.

          <p>
           There’s something about you something I can’t explain. I’ve never met you, never heard your voice, yet you feel like a dream I don’t want to wake up from. The way your eyes shine, the way your smile feels like just WOW </p>
 <p>
I often wonder how can someone I’ve never met feel so important? </p>
<p>

But admiration from afar isn’t enough anymore. I’m IMPATIENT I want to hear your voice, to know if it sounds as beautiful as I imagine. Soft and warm? Full of laughter? Whatever it is, I know I’d never get tired of listening. </p>
<p>

 I hope one day, I won’t just admire you from a distance I’ll finally get to hear the voice I’ve been waiting for.✨💖

<p>

I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you and how much I admire everything about you. </p> <p> I’m really thankful for the chance to have crossed paths with you, even if it’s only been for a short time. You’ve made an impact and I’m grateful for that.</p>

          <h2>The Best Part of My Day🤞💖</h2>
          <p>
            Talking to you has quickly become one of the best parts of my day. Every time I see your message, I smile without even trying. No matter how my day is going, talking to you makes everything feel calmer. </p>
<p>



And I can’t explain it properly, but these last 2.5 months of talking to you… they felt different. Iknw maybe it wasn’t right, and maybe I shouldn’t have let myself get used to it… but still this phase meant a lot to me. </p> <p> It was something really beautiful for me.</p>
<p>



I never thought simple conversations could mean this much… but with you, they do.

            I don’t know what the future holds, but I can honestly say that I’m enjoying this moment so much, and it’s all thanks to you. </p>
<p> If you hadn’t come into my life, I don’t think I would’ve felt this way. It’s hard to explain, but you make everything feel so special. </p>
<p>

And btw, I’m pretty sure you won’t find anyone better than me, handsome, cute, well-mannered, educated, and all that good stuff. (Haha JK!) </p>
<p> But I don’t even know what kind of guy you like, I’d be happy to become whatever you want me to be. If you don’t like my background, I’ll change that. If you think my face could be better, I’ll do whatever it takes. </p>
<p> Honestly, I just want to be the person you like, because all I really hope for in the end is that we meet someday.
